## 1. What is JSX, and why is it used?
JSX is a way to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript when working with React. It looks a lot like HTML, which makes creating user interfaces more intuitive and visually clear. Behind the scenes, React converts JSX into JavaScript instructions that efficiently update the webpage. This approach helps keep code organized by combining the structure of the UI with the logic needed to control it.

## 2. What is the difference between State and Props?**
State and props both hold data in React, but they serve different roles. State is private to a component and can change over time, often storing things like user input or toggle settings. Props, in contrast, are read-only values passed from a parent component down to its children to customize or configure them. Since props cannot be changed by the receiving component, this ensures a clear and predictable flow of data throughout the app.
